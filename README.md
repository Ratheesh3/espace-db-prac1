üìò E-Space Database Project (CIS5004 ‚Äì PRAC1)

üìñ Project Overview
This project implements a relational database for E-Space Solutions as part of the CIS5004 ‚Äì Database Systems module.
It covers the full database development lifecycle:

1.Conceptual modeling with ER diagram

2.Logical design with relational schema mapping & normalization (1NF‚Äì3NF)

3.Physical implementation in Microsoft SQL Server

4.User management & permissions (DCL)

5.Demonstration of transactions with ROLLBACK

6.Querying the database with multi-table SQL joins

üóÇ Repository Contents
TASK 3a - DATABSE & TABLE CREATION.sql -> SQL script to create the database, tables, constraints, and insert 5 sample records per table.

TASK 3b - USER CREATION and ROLES.sql -> SQL script to create user1, assign roles.

TASK 3c - PERMISSIONS.sql -> SQL script to set permissions.

TASK 3d - ROLLBACK DEMONSTRATION.sql -> SQL script to demonstrate ROLLBACK.

TASK 4 - Queries.sql -> Three sample SQL queries (Task 4).

ERD.jpg -> Conceptual Chen ER diagram.

map.jpg -> Map of ER Model to Relational Schema

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup Instructions
Open SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and log in as sa (system administrator).

Use your own local sa password (not provided here for security).

Run the script:
TASK 3a - DATABSE & TABLE CREATION.sql
This will create the database ESpaceDB, all tables, and populate them with 5 sample rows each.

Run:
TASK 3b - USER CREATION and ROLES.sql
This creates user1 and assign roles.

Run:
TASK 3c - PERMISSIONS.sql
This will sets permissions.

Test rollback with:
TASK 3d - ROLLBACK DEMONSTRATION.sql
Observe DELETE under user1 fails, and rollback under sa restores data.

Run:
TASK 4 - Queries.sql
to execute the 3 sample queries (Task 4).

üë• Users & Roles
sa ‚Üí System administrator.

Use your own SQL Server sa password when logging in.

Has full control of ESpaceDB with WITH GRANT OPTION.

user1 ‚Üí Test account created for assignment.
Username: user1

Password: User1Pass!

Permissions: SELECT only (cannot INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE).

üß™ Demonstrations
Data Control Language (DCL): Permissions enforced with GRANT.

Transaction Control: BEGIN TRAN + DELETE + ROLLBACK shows how unintended changes are reverted.

Queries: 3 multi-table joins demonstrate complex retrievals.

üìå Notes
Minimum 5 sample rows per table included.

All tables normalized to 3NF/BCNF.

Referential integrity enforced with primary & foreign keys.
